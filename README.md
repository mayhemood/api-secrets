I have used Secrets API (https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/) to make a website, named "Lipser". It is inspired from Whisper, a really famous app back in days that anonymously shows secrets of other users.

Please download the files in a folder, and then in node.js runtime, write "npm i" or "npm install" to get all node_modules. Thank you.
